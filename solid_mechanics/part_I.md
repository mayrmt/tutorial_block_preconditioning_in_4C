# Solving linear systems arising from 3D elasticity

The following instructions will guide you through different preconditioner options
to solve a linear system

$$Ax = b$$

arising from the finite element discretization of a cantilever beam using solid elements.

> The exact details of the problem setup are not important for the course of this tutorial
and, thus, are omitted for the sake of brevity.

The simulation model with three possible meshes is defined using the following files:

- `solid.4C.yaml`: simulation parameters and boundary conditions for clamped cantilever beam with endload performing a single solve of the linear sytem
- `gmres_solid.xml`: definition of a GMRES solver from Belos (required for iterative solvers throughout the tutorial)
- a series of mesh files `solid_*.exo` to change the size of the linear system to be solved (see table with meshing details)

Meshing details:

| Mesh file | #nodes x | #nodes y | #nodes z | #DOFs |  #MPI ranks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `solid_0.exo` | 3 | 3 | 15 | 405 | 1 |
| `solid_1.exo` | 12 | 12 | 60 | 25920 | 1 |
| `solid_2.exo` | 16 | 16 | 80 | 61440 | 2 |
| `solid_3.exo` | 20 | 20 | 100 | 120000 | 4 |
| `solid_3.exo` | 23 | 23 | 115 | 182505 | 6 |
| `solid_5.exo` | 25 | 25 |125 | 234375 | 8 |

Different preconditioners are predefined in the following files:

- `prec_solid_ifpack_Jacobi.xml`
- `prec_solid_ifpack_ILU.xml`
- `prec_solid_ifpack_GaussSeidel.xml`
- `prec_solid_muelu_sa_amg.xml`

They will be used and modified throughout this tutorial.

## Preliminary Steps

The default intput file comes with a direct solver, so you can run it right away.
To run it on `<numProc> MPI ranks, use the following command:

```bash
mpirun -np <numProcs> <4Cexe> solid.4C.yaml output
```

Please verify, that the simulation has finished successfully.

## Step 0: Iterative Solver without any Preconditioner

In theory, you can run a Krylov solver without any preconditioner and it will converge in $N$ iterations for a system with $N$ equations.
Since unpreconditioned Krylov solvers are know to deliver bad performance [^1], 4C does not offer this option,
and we also do not cover it in this tutorial.

## Step 1: Iterative Solver with Jacobi preconditioner

The `solid.4C.yaml` input file comes with a pre-configured iterative solver (GMRES) with a relaxation preconditioner, namely `Jacobi`.
In the input file, it is defined in `SOLVER 2`.
The preconditioner is configured in the file `prec_solid_Jacobi.xml`.

To switch to this solver, perform the following steps:

1. Open the `solid.4C.yaml` input file.
1. Familiarize yourself with the list `SOLVER 2` and the file `prec_solid_Jacobi.xml`.
1. To switch to the new solver,
   1. find the list `STRUCTURAL DYNAMIC`,
   1. modify the value of its parameter `LINEAR_SOLVER` to `2`.
1. Save the file `solid.4C.yaml`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```
STRUCTURAL DYNAMIC:
  INT_STRATEGY: "Standard"
  DYNAMICTYPE: "Statics"
  TIMESTEP: 1.0
  NUMSTEP: 1
  MAXTIME: 1
  MAXITER: 1
  DIVERCONT: "continue"
  LINEAR_SOLVER: 2
```

</details>

Now, run the example and watch the convergence behavior of the iterative solver.
Study the influence of the following parameters:

- Configuration of the preconditioner (defined in `prec_solid_ifpack_Jacobi.xml`):

  - Number of sweeps: `"relaxation: sweeps"`
  - Number of sweeps: `"relaxation: damping factor"`

- Mesh (to be set in `solid.4C.yaml`)

  - `solid_1.exo` (for 1 MPI process)
  - `solid_2.exo` (for 2 MPI processes)
  - `solid_3.exo` (for 4 MPI processes)
  - `solid_4.exo` (for 6 MPI processes)
  - `solid_5.exo` (for 8 MPI processes)

Discuss the observations with your colleagues.

## Step 2: Iterative Solver with Chebyshev preconditioner

The `solid.4C.yaml` input file comes with a pre-configured iterative solver (GMRES) with a relaxation preconditioner, namely `Jacobi`.
In the input file, it is defined in `SOLVER 2`.
The preconditioner is configured in the file `prec_solid_Jacobi.xml`.

To switch to GMRES with a Chebyshev preconditioner, set the solid linear solver to `SOLVER 3`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```
STRUCTURAL DYNAMIC:
  INT_STRATEGY: "Standard"
  DYNAMICTYPE: "Statics"
  TIMESTEP: 1.0
  NUMSTEP: 1
  MAXTIME: 1
  MAXITER: 1
  DIVERCONT: "continue"
  LINEAR_SOLVER: 3
```

</details>

Now, run the example and watch the convergence behavior of the iterative solver.
Study the influence of the following parameters:

- Configuration of the preconditioner (defined in `prec_solid_ifpack_Chebyshev.xml`):

  - Polynomial degree: `"relaxation: sweeps"`

- Mesh (to be set in `solid.4C.yaml`)

  - `solid_1.exo` (for 1 MPI process)
  - `solid_2.exo` (for 2 MPI processes)
  - `solid_3.exo` (for 4 MPI processes)
  - `solid_4.exo` (for 6 MPI processes)
  - `solid_5.exo` (for 8 MPI processes)

Discuss the observations with your colleagues.

## Step 3: Iterative Solver with Incompluete-LU Factorization Preconditioner

1. Open the `solid.4C.yaml` input file.
1. In the list `SOLVER 1`,
   1. change the parameter `AZPREC` to `Ifpack`.
   1. change the parameter `IFPACK_XML_FILE` to `solid_ifpack_ILU.xml`.
1. Run the example.
1. Observe the convergence behavior of the iterative solver.

You can modify the settings of the ILU preconditioner by changing the file `solid_ifpack_ILU.xml`.
In particular,

- `Overlap` defines the overlap at processor boundaries (`0` = no overlap, larger values results in larger overlap)
- `fact: level-of-fill` defines the allowed fill-in (larger values result in a better approximation, however a more expensice setup procedure)

1. Change the ILU settings and explore their impact on runtime and iteration numbers.

## Step 4: Weak Scaling Behavior

We now compare the weak scaling behavior of the different preconditioners.
Due to its practival relevance, we study _weak scaling behavior_ [^2],
i.e., we increase the problem size at the same rate as the computing resources
yielding a constant load (number of unknowns) per MPI process
and expect a constant performance of the iterative solver.

For the purpose of this tutorial,
we assess the performance by the number of GMRES iterations required to reach convergence.
For simplicity, we refrain from assessing timings in this tutorial.
