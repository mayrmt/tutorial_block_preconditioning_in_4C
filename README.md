# Block Preconditioning in 4C Multiphysics

## Context and Content

[4C Multiphysics](https://4c-multiphysics.org) defers the solution of systems of linear equations to [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io).
Therefore, this tutorial will

- use 4C Multiphysics to assemble linear systems
- introduce basic preconditioners for iterative solvers in Trilinos
- look into block preconditioning of multiphysics systems

## Prerequesites

This tutorial builds upon 4C Multiphysics.
It requires access to a build of 4C Multiphysics (newer than mid of June 2025).
The location of the 4C Multiphysics executable will be assumed as `<4Cexe>`

## Organization of Course Material

### Part I: Solving linear systems arising in 3D elasticity

- Part 1: Iterative Solver without any Preconditioner
- Part 2: Iterative Solver with relaxation-based Preconditioners
- Part 3: Iterative Solvers with Incomplete LU Factorization Preconditioners
- Part 4: Iterative Solver with algebraic multigrid (MueLu) Preconditioner

### Part II: Solving linear systems arising in 3D fluid/solid interaction

- Part 5: Iterative Solver with block-iterative preconditioner and AMG for block inverses
- Part 6: Iterative Solver with fully coupled AMG preconditioners
